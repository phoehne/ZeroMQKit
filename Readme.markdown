Zero MQ For IOS
===============

I am starting with the standard 3.1.1 ZeroMQ library and making a packaged
version for the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.  Why you might ask?  Because it's 
there?  No, because having a high performance messaging engine attached 
to a whole bunch of devices in the field that are almost always connected
creates some fascinating possibilities.
